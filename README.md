# Global NIT Validator

## One package to Rule Them All
There are plenty of NIT validators around the internet, but I've never seen one package that include every single NIT validator.
So... that's my goal! I'll update this package to contain a validator for every NIT existent.

## How do you validate?
All the NIT validations follows the [OECD Rules](http://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/crs-implementation-and-assistance/tax-identification-numbers/).
I'll try and keep this package updated with OECD website as much as possible.
